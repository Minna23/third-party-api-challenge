# third-party-api-challenge

This challenge was part of my Front-End Development bootcamp.
The aim was to code a daily planner with several functions. 
I used html, css, javaScript, moment.js

The tasks: 

## This daily planner should: 

Display the current day at the top of the calendar when a user opens the planner.

Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.

Color-code each timeblock based on past, present, and future when the timeblock is viewed.

Allow a user to enter an event when they click a timeblock.

Save the event in local storage when the save button is clicked in that timeblock.

Persist events between refreshes of a page.
